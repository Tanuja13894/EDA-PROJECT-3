# EDA-PROJECT-3 is a name of my project.
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze housing data to understand the factors that influence housing prices and to develop predictive models to estimate house prices based on various features.

## Objective
- Predict housing prices using various machine learning models.
- Identify key factors that influence housing prices.
- Provide insights and recommendations for potential real estate investors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to houses, such as:
- `House ID`: Unique identifier for each house.
- `Location`: The geographical location of the house.
- `Price`: The sale price of the house.
- `Number of Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `Number of Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `Size (sq ft)`: The size of the house in square feet.
- `Year Built`: The year the house was built.
- `Property Type`: The type of property (e.g., single-family, condo).
- `Additional Features`: Other relevant features such as garage, pool, etc.

## InstallationExploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process includes:

Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Insights derived from data distributions and relationships.
Model Development
Various machine learning models are developed and evaluated, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
XGBoost
Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared
Insights and Interpretation
Key findings and insights from the analysis include:

Factors most influencing housing prices.
Trends observed in different geographical locations.
Recommendations for potential investors.
Conclusion
The project successfully developed predictive models and provided insights into the factors affecting housing prices. The models can be used to estimate house prices and aid in investment decisions.

Future Work
Include additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis.
Develop a web application for real-time house price prediction.
Implement more advanced models and techniques.![2024-06-10](https://github.com/Tanuja13894/EDA-PROJECT-3/assets/162002938/c94db448-d781-4484-876a-c7a81e97f8e6)
